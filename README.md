# Java Math Operations Program

## Overview
This Java program performs various mathematical operations, including:
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers.
- Statistical computations (mean, variance, and standard deviation) on an array of numbers.
- Fibonacci sequence generation.

## Features
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform basic calculations on two user-input numbers.
- **Statistical Computations:** Compute mean, variance, and standard deviation for an array.
- **Fibonacci Sequence:** Generate the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Java 8 or later).

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd repository-name
   ```
3. Compile the Java program:
   ```sh
   javac MathOperations.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```sh
   java MathOperations
   ```

## Example Usage
```
Enter two numbers: 5 3
Addition: 8
Subtraction: 2
Multiplication: 15
Division: 1.67

Enter the size of the array: 5
Enter numbers: 1 2 3 4 5
Mean: 3.0
Variance: 2.5
Standard Deviation: 1.58

Enter the number of terms for Fibonacci: 7
Fibonacci Sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more mathematical functions (e.g., factorial, matrix operations).
- Add a GUI for better user interaction.
- Enhance input validation and error handling.
